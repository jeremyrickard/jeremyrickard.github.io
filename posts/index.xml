      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the good fortune of working with a great team on Open Service Broker for Azure for the last few months. What&amp;rsquo;s OSBA you ask? It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Service Broker API compliant service broker that enables you to easily provision and bind to services like MySQL, SQLDB and CosmosDB in Azure. I was familiar with service brokers from working with Cloud Foundry in the past, so I was really excited to join the Azure team and get a chance to work on bringing the great exeperience developers get using service brokers with CF to Kubernetes with Service Catalog!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m wrapping up 2017 with an exciting new job at Microsoft working on the super cool Azure Container Service. I really enjoyed my four years at VMware. I worked on really cool stuff and I worked with some really great people. So why make the change? I had reached a point where I felt like I was ready to do something different and I saw a really intersting job posting on Twitter.</description>
